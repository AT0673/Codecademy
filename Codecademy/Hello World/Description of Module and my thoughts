This module was a basic introduction to Python 3. I have practiced python before, but it was nice to go back over the basics. According to Codecademy, this module is to 'Get started with Python syntax in this lesson and then create a point of sale system for a furniture store!'
This is pretty accurate. This module taught the basics of python like concatenation, modulus, floats, variables, etc. Although it was a basic module, it was refreshing to go back over the basics to refresh my udimentary knowledge on python.
