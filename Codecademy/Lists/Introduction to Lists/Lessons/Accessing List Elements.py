#In Python, we call the location of an element in a list its index. 
#Python lists are zero-indexed. This means that the first element in a list has index 0, rather than 1.
#We can select a single element from a list by using square brackets ([]) and the index of the list item. If we wanted to select the third element from the list, weâ€™d use calls[2]:
