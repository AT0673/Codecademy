#In Python, for any data-type there is built-in functionality that we can use to create, manipulate, and even delete our data. We call this built-in functionality a method. 

#For lists, methods will follow the form of list_name.method(). Some methods will require an input value that will go between the parenthesis of the method ( ). 

#An example of a popular list method is .append(), which allows us to add an element to the end of a list.

orders = ["daisies", "periwinkle"]
print(orders)
orders.append("tulips")
orders.append("roses")
print(orders)
