# We’ve seen that the items in a list can be numbers or strings. Lists can contain other lists! We will commonly refer to these as two-dimensional (2D) lists.
# Previously, we saw that we could create a list representing both Noelle’s name and height:
#   noelle = ["Noelle", 61]
# We can put several of these lists into one list, such that each entry in the list represents a student and their height:
#   heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ava", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Mia", 64]]

heights = [["Jenny", 61], ["Alexus", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Grace", 64], ["Vik", 68]]
ages = [["Aaron", 15], ["Dhruti", 16]]
