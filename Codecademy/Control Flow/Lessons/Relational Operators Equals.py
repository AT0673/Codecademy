#The two relational operators weâ€™ll cover first are:
    #Equals: ==
    #Not equals: !=
#These operators compare two items and return True or False if they are equal or not.
#We can create boolean expressions by comparing two values using these operators:

# Determine if the following boolean expressions are True or False. Input your answer as True or False in the appropriate variable to the right.

#Statement 1: (5 * 2) - 1 == 8 + 1
statement_one = True

#Statement 2: 13 - 6 != (3 * 2) + 1
statement_two = False

#Statement 3: 3 * (2 - 1) == 4 - 1
statement_three = True
